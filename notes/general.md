# Overall ideas
The name of the game is "Who killed Uskar?". We start the game as a character which we have no ideas about. We don't know who our character is. We just know that the objective is to find out who killed Uskar. We don't even know who Uskar is. That is the only information we get.

We start the game in a room. It looks like a medieval castle chamber with medieval furniture. We can walk around that room and examine the objects in it. There are some notes that we can read, some paintings on the wall, and a door. If we open that door we go to the next room. The next room doesn't have any doors. We are stuck!

When we are inside a room the time from the outside world's perspective is frozen, which means it doesn't go forward. The time is not a progressive and continuous entity. It is discrete and has a certain integer number assigned to it. The value of time is shown as the attributes tracked in the game. There are certain actions that will cause the value of time go forward or backward. The game starts at time zero.

The first challange a player should tackle is to find out how to get out of these two rooms. It should work in a way that the player focuses more on knowing the mechanics of this world and how to make progress and know themselves rather than the main objective of the game which is finding out who killed Uskar.

Each room has a label. That is not exactly the name of the room but actually a question assigned to that room. The first room's question is "Who killed Uskar?". The second room's question is "How should I get out?" These questions should be designed in a way that when the player comes back to that room It still has meaning, perhaps in a different way. For example the answer to the question of "Who killed Uskar?" will finally be revealed when the player is in the first room. And whenever the player is in the second room they will need to figure out how to get out.
