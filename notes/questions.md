## How should I get out of here?
This is assigned to the second room which makes the player feel stuck.

## Is magic real?
This is a very tricky part of the game. The player shouldn't find out that he is able to bend the rules of the game or via magic they can do anything. Also it shouldn't be equivalent to some physical ability. For example if a player can lift something or hit something physically then there is no point to also do that via magic. Stuff that can be done via magic should not be possible to perform otherwise. This question is the begining of the journey of magical understanding for the player. Gradually throughout the game they find more and more about nature of magic and its abilities in the game.

## What time is it?
The concept of time is very tricky and intersting in the game. It governs some mechanics of the game. Some stuff in the game depend on the time. The player will gain an understanding of this concept answering this question. Time is discrete and it corresponds to an integer value.

## Are gods real?
There is a concept of gods who are beings who created that world and can control its creatures. The creatures of the game have no ideas or no connection with those gods. They just have these ideas. But every magic that happens in the game relates to the gods. Each magic essensially have a devine source. There is also levels of gods. Gods have their own universe. They may also have gods of their own. Not all of them have all the powers. For example a god can change weather, one may have created this entire universe, and some can only go into the minds of characters and control them to some degree.

## Who am I?
The player himself is a god. Answering this question will break the fourth wall. The player will find out that he is a god controlling this character. The extent which they can apply their powers to world and control the creatures can vary.
