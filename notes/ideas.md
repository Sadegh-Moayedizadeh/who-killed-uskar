# Ideas

## The player is able to control any character
Since the actual player is an outer god to the characters of the game, they should be capable of acting god when they know how to. The first devine act that is starting the game itself. By starting the game, the player controls the character he is playing with. The player is himself, not the character. This clarification should be made perfectly well when the player gets into the room called "Who am I?".
Progressing through the game, the player will find more about their ability as an outer god. One intersting ability can be controlling other characters in the game. This way they can bend their will and do stuff for them. It is also very important at what point in time the player starts controlling a character as their previous doings will still hold and have an effect on the game.

## Time is discrete
Since the time is discrete then we can model each discrete instance of time as an object that holds the state of the world and a link to the times that proceed it. Each instance of time will have a list of time instances that proceed it. This is like a graph structure.

## The concept of free will
This is one of the more obvious themes in this game. Since creatures are created and even sometimes to some degree controlled by the outer gods then we might say that they don't have any actual free will. But this has to be a bit tricky and less obvious. There should be circumstances and events in the game that questions this fact. There should be cases where things go out of control of the player and things become challenging to them. There should be situations where things seem obvious and doable to a player but it's very hard or even impossible to do. These situations should be designed in a way that the player feels things are out of his control. In a way the player who is an outer god should feed the same constraints and hardshipgs enforced to them as the creatures in the game feel. This should be done by the creatures that the player is not controlling.

## The distinction between gods and creatures

## Some objects contain a soul
We can distinguish objects (in general term) as having soul and soul-less. If an object has a soul then a god can find a way to control them. The souls themselves can have distinct categories. A sould also can be fluid and change over time. We can define souls in this sense as a link between a creature and a god. Creatures may be able to harm their souls to weaken that connection. Maybe this is an intensive to do horrible things. Maybe this was the intent to kill Uskerr.

## Mosters are creatures who destroyed their souls
In order for the creatures to attain free will they need to break their ties with the gods. Since the link between them and the gods is their souls they have to destroy their souls in order to be really free. But it comes with a cost. A soul contains certain attributes, morals, and personalities of a certain creature. Damaging ones soul will ultimately turn them into monsters.

## A character really dies
If a character the player is playing with dies, it dies for real. This should be done in a way that does not make the game boring and player won't have to make the same journey all the way back to where it was. Perhaps we can use the concept of time to make this possible.

## There are different branches of time
If going back in time is possible then we should consider this concept of different branches of time. If a player goes back in time and takes a different path that leads the character to somewhere new, since the character can't be at two different places at the same time then the timeline will split and we will have a new branch of time.


## Time is an object that holds the state of the world
Since everything in the world is time-bounded then we can define everything in respect to the time. 

## The subjective structure of time shapes our understanind of the world
It is our mind that understands everything in respect to the time. The player as a god has a time-bound understanding of the world. If something happens outside of the bounds of time then it is not possible to be understood by the gods therefore not able to be controlled. This is the real way to be free of gods which very few understand. The main reason for Uskerr to die and the player to start the game is to put the player in a process where they get stuck in time and kind of destroy the time completely and since the world is not understood out of the bounds of time by the gods then the creatures of the wolds will really be free and out of the reach of gods.

## Is freedom really desirable?
A main theme in this game is this concept of freedom and some creatures want to be free of gods and therefore the rules that govern their world. A question that the player should be dwelling with in the entire game is that the freedom is really a good thing?

## Splitting the time is a kardinal sin

## Kardinal sins damage one's soul

## Murder is a kardinal sin

## Soul is a discrete set of attributes
A soul seems to be a continuous entity but in fact can be modeled as a discrete entity. It is a collection of attributes. If a soul is damaged then some of its attributes are lost.

## Wizards are the ones with the strongest souls
Wizards lie on the other side of the spectrum. In contrast to demons who have got the weakest souls and monsters who have got no souls at all, wizards have the strongest souls. Their ties to the gods is so strong and pure. They enjoy being devine and controlled by the gods. It is the easiest for the gods to control wizards. They are the most equiped with attributes and abilities.

## If you loose a part of your soul something else will replace it

## Strengthening a soul also comes with a cost

## Characters can kill themselves with poison

## There is a cult of mass suicide
Poisons are not easy to aquire. You must join a cult of mass suicide.

## The player can control a character and kill it with poison

## Causality is when the order of phenomenons are enforced
Causality is a path in the graph of time.

## Sensibility is what labels time to phenomenons

## Understanding is what gathers the phenomenons
