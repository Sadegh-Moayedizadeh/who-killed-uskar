## The player is able to control any character
Since the actual player is an outer god to the characters of the game, they should be capable of acting god when they know how to. The first devine act that is starting the game itself. By starting the game, the player controls the character he is playing with. The player is himself, not the character. This clarification should be made perfectly well when the player gets into the room called "Who am I?".
Progressing through the game, the player will find more about their ability as an outer god. One intersting ability can be controlling other characters in the game. This way they can bend their will and do stuff for them. It is also very important at what point in time the player starts controlling a character as their previous doings will still hold and have an effect on the game.

## The concept of free will
This is a very tricky subject.

## The distinction between gods and creatures

## Some objects contain a soul
We can distinguish objects (in general term) as having soul and soul-less. If an object has a soul then a god can find a way to control them. The souls themselves can have distinct categories. A sould also can be fluid and change over time. We can define souls in this sense as a link between a creature and a god. Creatures may be able to harm their souls to weaken that connection. Maybe this is an intensive to do horrible things. Maybe this was the intent to kill Uskerr.
