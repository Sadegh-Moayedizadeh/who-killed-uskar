## The player is able to control any character
Since the actual player is an outer god to the characters of the game, they should be capable of acting god when they know how to. The first devine act that is starting the game itself. By starting the game, the player controls the character he is playing with. The player is himself, not the character. This clarification should be made perfectly well when the player gets into the room called "Who am I?".
Progressing through the game, the player will find more about their ability as an outer god. One intersting ability can be controlling other characters in the game. This way they can bend their will and do stuff for them. It is also very important at what point in time the player starts controlling a character as their previous doings will still hold and have an effect on the game.

## The concept of free will
This is one of the more obvious themes in this game. Since creatures are created and even sometimes to some degree controlled by the outer gods then we might say that they don't have any actual free will. But this has to be a bit tricky and less obvious. There should be circumstances and events in the game that questions this fact. There should be cases where things go out of control of the player and things become challenging to them. There should be situations where things seem obvious and doable to a player but it's very hard or even impossible to do. These situations should be designed in a way that the player feels things are out of his control. In a way the player who is an outer god should feed the same constraints and hardshipgs enforced to them as the creatures in the game feel. This should be done by the creatures that the player is not controlling.

## The distinction between gods and creatures

## Some objects contain a soul
We can distinguish objects (in general term) as having soul and soul-less. If an object has a soul then a god can find a way to control them. The souls themselves can have distinct categories. A sould also can be fluid and change over time. We can define souls in this sense as a link between a creature and a god. Creatures may be able to harm their souls to weaken that connection. Maybe this is an intensive to do horrible things. Maybe this was the intent to kill Uskerr.

## Mosters are creatures who destroyed their souls
In order for the creatures to attain free will they need to break their ties with the gods. Since the link between them and the gods is their souls they have to destroy their souls in order to be really free. But it comes with a cost. A soul contains certain attributes, morals, and personalities of a certain creature. Damaging ones soul will ultimately turn them into monsters.
