### Inventory
An inventory is where you hold artifacts.

### Lock
A player can use a lock and lock stuff like doors, inventories and so on. A lock needs to be aquired along with its key. A lock not only blocks access to an object but can also lock it in a place or a time. If the lock has an ability to lock an item to a place then it won't be moved. If a lock has the ability to lock an item to a time then it is only accessible in that certain time. If you come back in another time it won't be there.

### Note
There are some notes all over the place. All notes are signed. You can also leave notes which may change the course of the game. Notes can also be encoded. There may be different decodings. A note can also be destroyed, collected, or altered.

### Painting
A painting is somewhat similar to a note in a sense that they contain a clue or a message. But they are not encoded. They are visual.
Paintings are of places. If you posess strong magic you may affect the place that a painting shows. If a place changes that painting changes too. The painting shows that place at the begining of an integer time value.
Paintings can be physical or magical. Physical paintings are simply showing some static thing with no abilities mantioned above. They may only contain some information.
Magical paintings on the other hand are the ones that are described above as the ones that can affect remote places.

### Doll
Dolls are like paintings but they are of creatures. A doll shows the state of a creature at the begining of a time integer value. If you are demonic to a certain degree you are able to affect a creature or harm it via its doll. This act is a sin.
Dolls are physical or demonic. Physical dolls have no affect but demonic ones' abilities are described above.
