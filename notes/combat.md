# Combat
The combat system is an essential part of the game. The player can only fight via weapons.

## Weapons
There are swords and shields. A weapon has some specific techniques and abilities. The character doesn't need to learn or level up to be able to perform those techniques. They are simply built into the weapon. A weapon can be physical, magical, or demonic. A physical weapon won't change at all but a magical or demonic weapon can become more effective relative to the strength of the character's soul. If for example a character is very evil then a magical weapon will act simply like a physical one.

## Moves

### Roll
You can roll 

### Fake
You can fake hitting an enemy which causes them to parry premeturely and open their gaurd.

### Block
You can hold your shield up to block hits. But blocking a hit reduces your stamina much more than any other move. In a block direction is not important.

### Parry
You can parry in a very short and certain time window. In a parry direction is important.

### Hit
Hitting also costs stamina. If your hit gets parried your guard will be open for a certain time window. There are basic hits that are available in all physical swords. You should specify the direction of your hit and the press the hit botton. There are eight directions.

## Characteristics

### Stamina
A hit, parry, roll, or block costs stamina. If you stamina is empty it takes time for it to refill. The more health you got the faster your stamina refills.
When your stamina reaches its bottom it will make you unable to do anything that costs stamina making you open for getting hit.

### Health
You simply die when your health is over. You also deal less damage and loose max stamina if your health core drains. Your stamina refill speed also depends on your health.

### Sould strength
Stronger the sould the more damage a magical weapon deals.

### Evil strength
The more evil you are the more damage a demonic weapon deals.
