# Doors
There are different kinds of doors. Their primary function is to block or filter access and change time.

## Functions and attributes

### Block access
A door can be locked. A locked door blocks access for all creatures who don't have a key to that lock. Each door has its own lock. Some doors can be locked with an external lock.

### Filter access
A door can filter access of creatures in different circumstances. For example if a creature is bearing arms then they won't be allowed to pass.

### Change time
If a character passes a door the time changes. It can be different for each kind of a door. For example one kind of door will cause time to increment by one, the other makes it decrease by one, and the other won't change time.

### Direction
A door can only be one-way. You can pass a door and get into a room but necessariliy back.

### Visibility
A door can have certain levels of visibility. Some characters won't even be able to see a door if they don't pass their visibility criteria.

### Morphing
A door can morph into another door with different abilities. For example there can be a door that opens to another location but with proper magic it can morph into another kind of door that may open to another destination or affect on time in a different way. A locked door obviously cannot be morphed.

### Destination
A door should have one and only one destination where a creature gets after passing.
